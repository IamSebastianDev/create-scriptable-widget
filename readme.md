# ðŸš€ Create Scriptable Widget

A simple opinonated toolchain to simplify the development and deployment of **Scriptable Widgets**. [Scriptable](https://scriptable.js) is a simple way to automate iOs using JavaScript.

> **Please note:** This package is currently in development and at best, to be considered a prototype. There will be changes going forward that will probably break a lot of things. You can still use this package, but you might want to check back before publishing a widget to see if things changed significanlty.
